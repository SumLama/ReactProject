Login Page in React
This project is a simple and functional login page created using React and TypeScript.
It includes fields for entering a username and password, a "Login" button to submit the user credentials, and validation for both fields. 
The application communicates with an API endpoint to authenticate user credentials. 
On successful authentication, users are redirected to a welcome page. If the credentials are incorrect or if there are errors, appropriate messages are displayed to the user. 

Ensure node.js and npm are installed already.
